1. Project Title:
Predict Next Word using NLP


2. Description:
A simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that predicts the next word in a sequence of text using machine learning models. This project demonstrates text prediction based on historical patterns in a dataset.


3. Features:
  1. Predicts the next word in a given sentence or text.  
  2. Utilizes NLP techniques for processing and tokenizing text data.
  3. Implements a machine learning model for predictive analysis.


4. Technologies Used:
  1. Python
  2. TensorFlow/Keras (or any library you used)
  3. NLTK/spaCy (or other NLP libraries used)
  4. Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)

5. How to Run:
   1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predict-next-word-nlp.git
  2. Install the required dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Run the prediction script or notebook:
     python predict.py


6. Dataset:
  1. Briefly describe the dataset used for training the model (e.g., public dataset like Gutenberg corpus or custom dataset).
  2. Mention any preprocessing steps (like tokenization, padding, etc.).


7. Model:
  1. Describe the architecture of the model (e.g., LSTM, GRU).
  2. Mention key parameters like number of layers, activation functions, etc.


8. Usage:
  1. Show an example of how to input text and get a prediction:
     1. Input: "Artificial intelligence is"
        Output: "changing"


9. Contributing:
Guidelines for others to contribute to the project.
