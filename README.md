## Predict Next Word using NLP


## Description:
A simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that predicts the next word in a sequence of text using machine learning models. This project demonstrates text prediction based on historical patterns in a dataset.


## Features:
  * Predicts the next word in a given sentence or text.  
  * Utilizes NLP techniques for processing and tokenizing text data.
  * Implements a machine learning model for predictive analysis.


## Technologies Used:
  * Python
  * TensorFlow/Keras (or any library you used)
  * NLTK/spaCy (or other NLP libraries used)
  * Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)

## How to Run:
   * Clone the repository:
      * git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predict-next-word-nlp.git
   * Install the required dependencies:
      * pip install -r requirements.txt
   * Run the prediction script or notebook:
      * python predict.py


## Dataset:
  * Briefly describe the dataset used for training the model (e.g., public dataset like Gutenberg corpus or custom dataset).
  * Mention any preprocessing steps (like tokenization, padding, etc.).


## Model:
  * Describe the architecture of the model (e.g., LSTM, GRU).
  * Mention key parameters like number of layers, activation functions, etc.


## Usage:
  * Show an example of how to input text and get a prediction:
     * Input: "Artificial intelligence is"
        Output: "changing"
